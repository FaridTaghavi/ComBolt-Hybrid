>To do list:
    1. After encountering the error -> stop the evolution and save a log file.
        a. In the the log file the time step and error message need to be uncluded.
            i. Landau matching -> Non of the eignvalues are posive

    2. Incuding dynamical step for RK.
    Status: done

    3. Test more advanced RK methods.
    Status:

    4. Include mass scale to the system.
    Status:

    5. Include HDF5 format.
    Status:

    6. Include ROOT.
    Status: partially done

    7. The observables can be calculated on the fly. Put them in the main loop later.
    Status:

    8. Many functions in small_opacity file is a copy paste of those in initial state and RK4MoC. 
        It is very unprofessional. Write a single file to use functions in different cases.
    Status: Not relevant
    
    9. The initial state functions return a discretize grid. We can use the more efficient method to use the output as an argument 
        of a void function.
    Status: done

    10. The dynamical grid is implemented. But I believe the interpolation along vp is written very messy. It should be written in a more 
        efficient way.
    Status:

    11. We can add a C++ROOT wrapper to save the UrQMD result directly to a ROOT file. At the moment, we read .dat file and save it as a .root.

The improvements suggestion from Numerical Recipes
    1. Roundoff Error (section 1.1.2 and 5.6)
        a. Check if there is any case similar to the example in 5.6 and try to avoid it.
    2. I should be able to use more constructors.
        a. Check if in the code I can use scope "{" and "}" to release memory (section 1.3.2)
    3. Clearly I can use functors (section 1.3.3) to pass findneighbours, or even collision kernels
       to the RK4 case.
    4. Check if the inheritances are really needed (maybe good to keep). If not remove them 
       for simplicity.
